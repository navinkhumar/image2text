â€œIn my Image-to-Text Converter project, I implemented OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using Python. The goal was to extract text content from image files efficiently.

Here's how it worked:

Image Preprocessing:
I used the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle tasks like:

Resizing and cropping the image to reduce noise

Grayscale conversion to simplify image data

Format conversion (e.g., JPEG to PNG) when needed

OCR Engine:
I used Tesseract OCR, an open-source OCR engine via the pytesseract library in Python. This engine scans the image, recognizes character patterns, and converts them into readable text.

Error Handling:
I implemented try-except blocks to catch errors like unreadable images, missing files, or incorrect formats. This helped maintain stability during runtime.

Output:
The extracted text was either displayed in the console or saved to a .txt file, depending on the user's choice.

Use Case:
This tool can be very useful for digitizing printed documents or extracting data from scanned receipts, forms, etc.
